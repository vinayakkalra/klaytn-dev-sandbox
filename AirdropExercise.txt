Create a contract that will have a mapping of addresses that are sent an airdrop of 1 Klay (every unique user will be airdroped 1 Klay)
Once an address is Airdropped, it should not be sent Klay again
Create a deploy script on truffle to create the contract and fund the contract with 10 klay
Create tests to confirm the deployments

Hints:
1. Deposit some Klay - create a deposit function
2. transfer function - to transfer funds from the contracts
